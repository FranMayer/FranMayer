# console.log(Hello! 🚀👽)

Hi, I’m Franco! I’m 28 years old and from Córdoba, Argentina. I’m focused on improving my skills through self-learning and courses from platforms like Udemy and APX Academy. Throughout my journey, I’ve worked on projects ranging from responsive design to implementing modern frameworks like **Bootstrap 5** and **Sass**, optimizing every detail to ensure a flawless user experience. Additionally, my knowledge of **JavaScript** and tools like **Milligram.js** has allowed me to create dynamic interfaces that balance aesthetics and functionality.
